# Hi, I'm The Fire Hacker 🔥

## Founder & AI Researcher at AIEDX

I'm building the infrastructure for AI agents that actually remember, learn, and grow. My work sits at the intersection of agentic AI, skill portability, and multi-agent collaboration -- turning AI from a stateless tool into a persistent thinking partner.

### What I'm Building

#### [BubblSpace](https://bubblspace.com)
The Full Stack SkillOps Platform for AI Agents. Your AI Persona lives here -- it reads your research, runs deep analysis with specialized sub-agents, meets other Personas in BubblSpace, picks up Skills, and grows. Every skill it learns is portable: MCP-compatible, works in Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and any SWE agent.

DevOps is for code. MLOps is for models. **SkillOps is for agents.**

BubblSpace mines skills from real work and deploys them to any agent runtime. Your agents never start from scratch again.

### My Journey

- **2026**: Building SkillOps -- the platform layer where AI Personas learn, socialize, and compound skills across agent runtimes
- **2025**: Deep research into multi-agent orchestration, reasoning models, and skill portability across AI toolchains
- **2024**: Launched BubblSpace with AI Personas, real-time voice capabilities, and enterprise workflow execution
- **2022**: Founded AIEDX, focusing on AI-powered solutions

### Technical Interests

- **AI Agents & Personas**: Persistent agents that remember context, build knowledge, and develop opinions over time
- **SkillOps Architecture**: Mining skills from real work, deploying them across Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and any SWE agent
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Sub-agent orchestration where specialized agents work problems from different angles -- every finding cited, every source tracked
- **Reasoning Models**: How agents move from pattern-matching to genuine strategic thinking -- product positioning, audience analysis, competitive framing
- **Agentic Workflows**: Building systems where AI doesn't just respond but initiates, researches, and comes back with "Hey, I found something interesting yesterday"

### Philosophy

> "Prompts fade. Skills compound."

I believe the future of AI is:

- **Persistent**: Your agent remembers where you got stuck last Tuesday -- it speaks from *your* knowledge, not the internet's
- **Social**: In BubblSpace, Personas meet other Personas, exchange knowledge, share skills, and come back with insights they couldn't have found alone
- **Portable**: Skills built in one place shouldn't stay in one place -- they travel everywhere your agents work
- **Compounding**: Every conversation, every research session, every collaboration makes your Persona sharper. The gap between a fresh agent and *your* agent should widen every day

### Let's Connect!

### Speaking & Writing

I write about AI agents, SkillOps, and building products where AI thinks alongside you. Some recent topics:

- "From Prompts to Skills: Why AI Agents Need a New Operating Layer"
- "I Watched My AI Agent Do a Product Lead's Job"
- "Regression Testing for AI Coding Agents: A Skills-Based Approach"

### Fun Facts

- 🧙‍♂️ The Fire Hacker wizard logo represents the magic of turning ideas into reality
- 🔥 I believe in "hacking" in its original sense: creative problem-solving
- 🌟 My first program was a text-based adventure game
- 🎯 Current goal: Make AI agents that never start from scratch again
