# Hi, I'm The Fire Hacker 🔥

## Founder & AI Researcher at AIEDX

I'm passionate about democratizing AI and building tools that empower individuals and businesses to harness the power of artificial intelligence. My work focuses on making AI accessible, practical, and privacy-preserving.

### What I'm Building

#### [Bubblspace](https://bubblspace.com)
A revolutionary platform for creating and sharing AI-powered experiences in collaborative spaces. Think of it as Google Docs meets AI playground, where teams can work together with multiple AI models in real-time.

#### [TimeCapsule-SLM](https://timecapsule.bubblspace.com)
Small Language Models designed specifically for preserving and sharing memories through time. This project explores how we can use AI to create meaningful connections with our past and future selves.

### My Journey

- **2025**: Focused on  AI research initiatives in distributed systems to build Efficient small models
- **2024**: BuildingBubblSpace: AI Pesronas with real time voice to voice capabiltiles to execute Enterprise Workflows 
- **2022**: Founded AIEDX, focusing on local-first AI solutions

### Technical Interests

- **Small Language Models (SLMs)**: AI models that can run locally or small cluster of GPUs.
- **Distributed Computing**: Scaling AI across multiple nodes for both training and inference.
- **AI-Frames**: Open learning with the help of AI.

### Open Source Contributions

I believe in giving back to the community. Check out my projects:

- [TimeCapsule-SLM](https://github.com/aiedx/timecapsule-slm) - Local-first memory preservation


### Philosophy

> "The best AI is the one that runs on your device, respects your privacy, and enhances your capabilities without replacing your creativity."

I believe the future of AI is:
- **Local-first**: Your data stays on your device
- **Collaborative**: AI should enhance human collaboration
- **Accessible**: Everyone should benefit from AI advances
- **Transparent**: Understanding how AI makes decisions

- **Email**: [firehacker@bubblspace.com](mailto:firehacker@bubblspace.com)

### Speaking & Writing

I occasionally speak at conferences and write about AI, distributed systems, and building products. Some recent topics:

- "Small Models, Big Impact: The Future of Edge AI"
- "Building Privacy-First AI Applications"
- "From Research to Product: Shipping AI Features Users Love"

### Fun Facts

- 🧙‍♂️ The Fire Hacker wizard logo represents the magic of turning ideas into reality
- 🔥 I believe in "hacking" in its original sense: creative problem-solving
- 🌟 My first program was a text-based adventure game
- 🎯 Current goal: Make AI accessible to 1 million users
