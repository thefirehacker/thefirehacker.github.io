# Hi, I'm The Fire Hacker 🔥

## Founder & AI Researcher at AIEDX

I'm passionate about democratizing AI and building tools that empower individuals and businesses to harness the power of artificial intelligence. My work focuses on making AI accessible, practical, and privacy-preserving.

### What I'm Building

#### [Bubblspace](https://bubblspace.com)
A revolutionary platform for creating and sharing AI-powered experiences in collaborative spaces. Think of it as Google Docs meets AI playground, where teams can work together with multiple AI models in real-time.

#### [TimeCapsule-SLM](https://timecapsule.bubblspace.com)
Small Language Models designed specifically for preserving and sharing memories through time. This project explores how we can use AI to create meaningful connections with our past and future selves.

### My Journey

- **2025**: Founded AIEDX, focusing on local-first AI solutions
- **2024**: Led AI research initiatives in distributed systems
- **2023**: Contributed to open-source LLM optimization projects
- **2022**: Started exploring edge AI deployment strategies

### Technical Interests

- **Small Language Models (SLMs)**: Optimizing AI for edge devices
- **Privacy-Preserving AI**: Building systems that respect user data
- **Distributed Computing**: Scaling AI across multiple nodes
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Synchronizing AI interactions
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Connecting information meaningfully

### Open Source Contributions

I believe in giving back to the community. Check out my projects:

- [TimeCapsule-SLM](https://github.com/aiedx/timecapsule-slm) - Local-first memory preservation
- [Bubble-Sync](https://github.com/bubblspace/bubble-sync) - Real-time collaboration engine
- [AI-Orchestra](https://github.com/bubblspace/ai-orchestra) - Multi-model orchestration library

### Philosophy

> "The best AI is the one that runs on your device, respects your privacy, and enhances your capabilities without replacing your creativity."

I believe the future of AI is:
- **Local-first**: Your data stays on your device
- **Collaborative**: AI should enhance human collaboration
- **Accessible**: Everyone should benefit from AI advances
- **Transparent**: Understanding how AI makes decisions

### Speaking & Writing

I occasionally speak at conferences and write about AI, distributed systems, and building products. Some recent topics:

- "Small Models, Big Impact: The Future of Edge AI"
- "Building Privacy-First AI Applications"
- "From Research to Product: Shipping AI Features Users Love"

### Fun Facts

- 🧙‍♂️ The Fire Hacker wizard logo represents the magic of turning ideas into reality
- 🔥 I believe in "hacking" in its original sense: creative problem-solving
- 🌟 My first program was a text-based adventure game
- 🎯 Current goal: Make AI accessible to 1 million users
