## Introduction

TimeCapsule-SLM represents a breakthrough in personal AI applications, bringing the power of Small Language Models (SLMs) to memory preservation and storytelling. In this post, I'll walk you through setting up and deploying your own TimeCapsule-SLM instance.

## Why Small Language Models?

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the world's attention, SLMs offer unique advantages for personal applications:

- **Privacy-first**: Run entirely on your device
- **Cost-effective**: No API fees or cloud dependencies
- **Customizable**: Fine-tune for your specific use case
- **Fast inference**: Real-time responses on consumer hardware

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

```bash
# Python 3.9 or higher
python --version

# Node.js for the web interface
node --version

# Git for cloning the repository
git --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone the TimeCapsule-SLM repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiedx/timecapsule-slm
cd timecapsule-slm
```

2. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the base model:

```bash
python scripts/download_model.py --model-size small
```

## Configuration

TimeCapsule-SLM uses a simple YAML configuration file. Create `config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  name: "timecapsule-small"
  quantization: "int8"
  max_tokens: 2048

memory:
  storage_path: "./memories"
  embedding_model: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  
interface:
  port: 8080
  theme: "fire-hacker"
```

## Your First Time Capsule

Let's create your first memory:

```python
from timecapsule import TimeCapsule

# Initialize the capsule
capsule = TimeCapsule(config_path="config.yaml")

# Create a memory
memory = capsule.create_memory(
    title="Building TimeCapsule-SLM",
    content="Today marks the beginning of something special...",
    tags=["milestone", "ai", "personal"]
)

# Generate a narrative
narrative = capsule.generate_narrative(
    memories=[memory],
    style="reflective"
)

print(narrative)
```

## Advanced Features

### Memory Embeddings

TimeCapsule-SLM uses semantic embeddings to connect related memories:

```python
# Find similar memories
similar = capsule.find_similar(
    query="first day at work",
    limit=5
)
```

### Temporal Awareness

The model understands time relationships:

```python
# Generate a timeline
timeline = capsule.create_timeline(
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-12-31"
)
```

## Performance Optimization

For optimal performance on edge devices:

1. **Use quantization**: Reduces model size by 75%
2. **Enable caching**: Speeds up repeated queries
3. **Batch processing**: Process multiple memories together

## What's Next?

In upcoming posts, I'll cover:

- Fine-tuning TimeCapsule-SLM on your personal data
- Building a mobile app interface
- Integrating with photo and video memories
- Creating shared family time capsules

## Conclusion

TimeCapsule-SLM demonstrates that powerful AI doesn't always require massive models. By focusing on a specific domain and optimizing for edge deployment, we can create meaningful, privacy-preserving applications that run anywhere.
