```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access TimeCapsule-SLM!

## Setting Up Local AI Models

For the best privacy and offline experience, use local models with Ollama:

### Install Ollama

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Windows - Download from ollama.ai
```

### Pull Recommended Models

```bash
# For research and general tasks
ollama pull gemma:2b

# For code and technical content
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b

# For creative writing
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

## Using TimeCapsule-SLM

### Creating Your First Research Project

1. **Initialize a Knowledge Base**:
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose your domain (Research, Education, Personal)
   - Select your preferred AI model

2. **Import Your Documents**:
   - Drag and drop PDFs, Word docs, or text files
   - The system will automatically index and embed them
   - All processing happens locally in your browser

3. **Start Researching**:
   - Use natural language queries to explore your knowledge base
   - The AI will surface relevant information and suggest connections
   - Generate summaries, insights, and new research directions

### Building AI-Frames for Learning

Create interactive learning experiences with AI-Frames:

```javascript
// Example AI-Frame configuration
{
  "title": "Introduction to Quantum Computing",
  "modules": [
    {
      "type": "video",
      "content": "intro-video.mp4",
      "ai_notes": true
    },
    {
      "type": "interactive",
      "content": "qubit-simulator",
      "ai_guidance": "adaptive"
    },
    {
      "type": "quiz",
      "ai_generated": true,
      "difficulty": "progressive"
    }
  ]
}
```
